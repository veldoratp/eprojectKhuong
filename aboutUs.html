    <h3>At Rhythm.com, we believe everyone deserves to have a online store. Innovation and simplicity makes us happy: our goal is to remove any technical or financial barriers that can prevent you purchase in my website. We're excited to help you on your journey!

        Rhythm.com began in 2020. After years in the online store industry, we realized that it was near impossible for people want purchase online. Traditional online store services were simply too complicated, time consuming, and expensive to manage.
        
        After seeing an increased need for ecommerce solutions, we developed one of the only fully-featured, free and commission-free online store builders, allowing any people to purchase online.
